# Multi-tape machines with optional oracle channels

This core separates the tape interface from the choice of a transition. `Oracle` indexes
communication operations: `Empty` removes them, while `Unit` describes one operation. Each channel
has a write-only query buffer and a read-only answer tape. Ordinary actions still use
`Turing.Action`; input, work tapes, output and control still use `Turing.Cfg`.

The operation type names interfaces such as hashing, signing and decryption; it does not contain
their request payloads. Payloads are words written to the selected query buffer, so a finite
operation type still permits arbitrarily long requests. At the game level, `PFunctor.FreeM` can use
typed payloads and operation-dependent replies; a machine realization must encode these as words.

Different operations may share one hidden interpreter state. Separate communication channels do
not assert independent oracles. In particular, a random-oracle handler must retain its sampled
answers across every user of that oracle, including calls made inside another game operation.

`Choose` describes the transition table's result. A relation uses `Set`, a deterministic table
uses `Id`, and a fair-coin table uses `fun α => Bool → α`. In particular, the fair-coin
presentation keeps the action for each coin value, including when the two actions agree.

No finiteness or complexity assumptions are imposed here. A complexity predicate must require
fixed finite control, a finite alphabet and finitely many oracle channels. With these assumptions
an ordinary step inspects and updates a fixed number of tape cells. Query submission is a separate
step; writing the query and reading its reply require ordinary steps.

The empty-channel equivalences remove both query instructions and communication state.
They allow existing deterministic and nondeterministic APIs to retain their ordinary tape types.
