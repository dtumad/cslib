# Monotone operations and limits of measures

This file supplies two small order-theoretic facts for Mathlib measures. Giry bind is monotone in
a measurable measure-valued continuation, and the lattice supremum of an increasing sequence of
measures is its pointwise supremum on measurable sets.

The second fact is the measure-theoretic basis for interpreting progressively deeper observations
of a potentially nonterminating computation: returned mass grows with fuel, and its limit remains
a measure rather than merely a pointwise set function.
